Here's your summary for the week. \n\n## 🌥 Dealing With Difficult Days \n\nThe past week has had its fair share of ups and downs. There were days when you \"felt pretty down\", woke up \"feeling super tired and just defeated\". During these times, you seemed challenged by social interactions, or even doubting your competence. It's important to remember, Johnny, that such days are not always reflective of your worth, capability or identity. We all have off days, and that's perfectly normal. \n\nMoreover, your concussion is still affecting you, preventing you from getting back into your fitness routine. Make sure you take care of your health  and give your body the rest it needs in order to recover. \n\n## ☺️‍‍‍ Small Bites Of Happiness \n\nDespite tough times, there were some moments of light that shone through your week. Your interactions with Charlotte seem to bring you joy and comfort. Make sure to appreciate these moments and give them the importance they deserve. \n\nSmall achievements such as \"getting a lot of work done\", and attempting to create a clean environment highlights your ability to channel energy into productive activities even when things are tough. \n\n## 🍲‍‍ It's Okay to Indulge Sometimes \n\nYou've noted some less healthy meals and \"drank a beer\" to feel better on a rough day. Just remember, it's perfectly okay to indulge sometimes. Yet, maintaining a balance is crucial. Fueling your body with nutritious food can also contribute to your overall well-being and mood. \n\n> You're doing a wonderful job growing, Johnny, even if sometimes it may not seem that way. Remember, every step you take, regardless of its size, brings you closer to healing and self-improvement. Life may have its struggles and setbacks, continue to stand strong and keep moving forward. 💪💛\",\n\n\"context\": \"Johnny has had a challenging week, facing both emotional and physical obstacles. He still suffers from the symptoms of a previous concussion which impedes him from working out, an activity he misses. There are moments of self-doubt and lethargy, but Johnny tries to stay productive and take care of the tasks. He seems to find solace in the company of his girlfriend, Charlotte. He also acknowledges his diet and behavioral patterns, including nail-biting.

Your entries offer insightful reflections. Let's look at the highlights of this week: \n\n## 📉 Coping with Low Confidence\nIt seems that there were moments this past week when you felt socially incompetent and self-confidence was slightly lower. Remember, everyone has such moments. The key is to not let these thoughts define your worth. Keep in mind that reactions don't always have to be perfect. You're human after all! 😊\n\n## 🚧 Handling Workload\nOne shining part of your week was your capability to handle quite a bit of work and accomplish certain tasks, even on some challenging days. High Five for that 🙌! This shows your resilience and dedication. Just make sure to have a balance and not to overwork yourself. 🌳\n\n## 🎭 Managing Emotions\nYou appear to be navigating a range of emotions effectively. Whether feeling down, defeated, or energized, you kept moving forward. Kudos to your emotional resilience! 🎆 But don't forget, it's okay to take a step back and rest when needed.  Relaxation and good sleep is a key aspect of maintaining a healthy state of mind. 🌙\n\n> Remember, it's okay not to be okay sometimes. Continue writing in your journal about your thoughts, it will help in self-reflection. Recognize your resilience and how far you've reached. The journey is just as important as the goal. Embrace all experiences, seek growth in challenges, and be proud of your progress. 💪🚀\",\n\n  \"context\": \"Johnny experienced a general mix of emotions this week within the ambit of work, social interactions, and self-confidence. Physical health concerns like lingering concussion symptoms and disruptions to normal routines were also issues during the week. Despite these challenges, he managed productivity in terms of work and household errands, and also attempted to maintain social connections. He showed signs of resilience, but may need to focus on self-care and maintaining a balanced lifestyle in coming weeks.\"\n} Bad control character in string literal in JSON at position 211","stack":"SyntaxError: Bad control character in string literal in JSON at position 211\n    at JSON.parse (<anonymous>)\n    at Function.<anonymous> (/Users/johnroy/Development/journal/apps/server/src/services/OpenAiService.ts:68:29)\n    at step (/Users/johnroy/Development/journal/apps/server/src/services/OpenAiService.ts:33:23)\n    at Object.next (/Users/johnroy/Development/journal/apps/server/src/services/OpenAiService.ts:14:53)\n    at fulfilled (/Users/johnroy/Development/journal/apps/server/src/services/OpenAiService.ts:5:58)\n    at processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:95:5)"}
